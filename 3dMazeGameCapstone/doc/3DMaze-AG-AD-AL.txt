Introduction: 


For our project, we are planning on creating a 3-Dimensional maze game with interactions with the player. Our program generates a 3-Dimensional maze with various puzzles and puts you in a 1st person view of the maze. You have to wander through the maze and try and find the exit to the maze. We wrote this program based on the challenges we had with the Maze challenge in the recursion in 2-Dimensional arrays lab. However, we wanted to put our own spin on it, and decided to create a 3-Dimensional maze as it would be more challenging and we would learn how to render blocks in the third dimension. You enter a maze-like place where if you don’t escape in a certain time then the whole world will fall into chaos. The main rules are you can’t see the whole maze from a birds eye view, there is a time limit to solve the maze, you cannot go through the walls, and you have to get around traps and puzzles that may send you all the way back. The goal is to escape and save the world because for some reason the evil mage has his power source stuck inside the maze. When you escape the maze, the power source is destroyed and the mage loses his powers. The players should be around high school age to use the program as the memory skills and logic required will have to be strong to successfully complete the puzzle. There will be a way to exit the current session in the case that you want to reset the maze after you change the difficulty or some other option.


Instructions:
[Explain how to use the program. This needs to be specific: 
Which keyboard keys will do what? 
The space bar will move you the direction you are looking. If you need to turn, use your mouse to face that direction.
Where will you need to click? Keys Clicked will be the spacebar and the escape key (esc on top left).
Will you have menus that need to be navigated? What will they look like? 
There will be a menu for the difficulty of the maze and it will look like a regular menu of someone who enters a game and wants to choose the difficulty on a GUI with two levels. There will also be another menu that can be accessed mid game to reset.
Do actions need to be taken in a certain order?
Actions do need to be taken in a certain order as you need to respond to the necessary prompts like the difficulty and perhaps the mode before you start.






Features List (THE ONLY SECTION THAT CANNOT CHANGE LATER):
Must-have Features:


* A feature we need is a menu screen and a home screen. The home screen will have the options between the multiple levels. There will also be a menu screen ingame that will take you to the home screen.


* The maze will be viewed in first person. There will be a renderer that updates the player’s view of the 3D maze.


*  Traps in the maze which will send the user to the start of the maze without the timer resetting.[a]
        
* There will be multiple mazes of different difficulties. The user will be able to choose which [b]maze they want to do.[c]


* There will be a timer that displays the amount of time you have left to complete the maze.


*  The maze could be randomly generated. This way, each level will change every time so if you fail the first time it will be slightly different.[d]


Want-to-have Features:
*  3D-shaped maze?[e]


* A score system which is based on the amount of time you finish with. It will be like a standard[f] scores system with three stars being the best.


* There will be a puzzle at the end of the game to exit the maze. There will be a riddle that we found off the internet that will need to be answered to exit the game.[g][h]


*  An optional map for a single layer that you can toggle on and off at the menu screen.


*  A multiplaye[i]r mode that can be played with another player in a race type situation.
 
*  Interactions [j]with the maze that will need to be made in the correct order to solve the maze.[k][l]


Stretch Features:
*  Graphics optimization so that the program isn’t laggy.


*  A Leaderboard system which records all scores across the program users and displays them in a ranking of the top 10.


*  Credits screen that displays the high scores and the names of the creators.




Class List:
Main - the main java class
HomeScreen - the first screen a person sees that has options to play
MenuScreen - the menu a players sees when hitting a certain key
Trap- Creates the various traps throughout the maze
Camera - The class that lets you see things in 3D
Maze - keeps track of the maze is a 2D version
Player - All controls of the player
MazeRunner - To update the player’s perspective as they move

* Aayush Lakhotia: Create the traps, logic puzzles


* Ameya Gandhi: README features list, help Abbas render the maze, work on controls for the user


* We will use processing.js for the 3D part, using eclipse to write the program.
* We used the 3D maze workshop from HHS Programming in our project

[a]Can traps do something more interesting than simply a reset?


Monsters? Movement?
[b]In my opinion, with the time limit, I think it would be better to have just have one maze as a must-have feature and focus more on the puzzles and features of the specific maze (like make the scoring system more complex) or the multiplayer mode.
[c]Maybe make the mazes randomly generated instead of giving selections or the user could just memorize the mazes
[d]Actually, can we move this to a must-have feature? This request is based on the fact that the 3D demo walks through a lot of the process of creating a hard-coded 3D maze. So a randomly generated maze would be your addition on top of this demo.
[e]Up to you - but it's interesting.
[f]I think it would be cool if you also based a part of the score on how well the user completes the puzzles and avoids the traps. Or since it is based primarily on time, the user could acquire certain 'powers' to stop the timer by doing well on the puzzles.
[g]Will there be a blur recognition in case user use different words to describe the same thing? Like if user put the word "cellphone" when the correct answer is "phone"
[h]Will the player get multiple tries? Would they be able to get hints to the riddles by going to certain parts of the maze? Or will this decide victory or game over?
[i]A multiplayer mode would be really cool if implemented well.
[j]In my opinion, since you are adding traps, you could add other items to the maze which can help the player. For example, you can make an item which shows you which way the exit is from where the player is standing for 3 seconds. You could also make an item which stops time. If you feel like these items will be too OP, you can toggle the helpful items on and off depending on the difficulty of the game set by the player.
[k]Are these traps/puzzles (that is what I assume you mean by interaction) necessary in order to win? If so, the difficulty may become quite challenging with the timer. Maybe completing these puzzles will increase the timer's time?
[l]I'm not entirely sure about what you mean by interactions with the maze. I think you should elaborate more on this or give an example.
